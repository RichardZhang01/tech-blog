## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to implement all of the things I've learned about MVC to develop a full-stack application that mimics a simple blog website. 
- I built this project to understand the MVC development process, all of the pieces involved, and how they relate to each other.
- This project aimed to create a simple website that allows users to interact with one another through blog-posts. It allows users to create accounts, or log in to existing accounts, and access a dashboard to create, edit, and delete posts. It also allows users to create comments on posts when they are logged in.
- Through this project, I learned a lot about MVC. I also learned how to develop a full-stack application. Specifically, I learned about the various pieces of the MVC puzzle and how they fit together. I learned about the development process of a full-stack application. I initially was confused about what I should have been working on first, but this project definitely helped a lot in organizing the order in which I worked on pieces of the application. I also learned a lot about handlebars, how powerful it is, how the different handlebars documents fit together, and the logic associated with it. Finally, this project helped me to further develop some of the skills we've been learning throughout the past few weeks such as routing, express, and SQL, as well as things that we haven't been touching for some time, such as the front-end, CSS, HTML, and JS.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

This application is deployed to Heroku, and you can access it [here](https://richard-zhang-note-taker.herokuapp.com/).

Alternatively, you can clone this repo. 

If performing a manual installation, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

To install dependencies, open in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and in the terminal run: 

      npm install 

Alternatively, you can navigate to the application's installation location in [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or similar command-line tool) and do the same.

Before running the app, create a file named `.env` in the main folder with the following lines in the `.env` file:

      DB_USER='<your mySQL username>'
      DB_PW='<your mySQL password>'
      DB_NAME='techBlog_db'

Replace the `DB_USER` and `DB_PW` fields with your credentials.

To create the database, in the terminal start MySQL by running:

      mysql -u <your MySQL username> -p

Then create the database by running:

      source ./db/schema.sql;

`Exit` MySQL, and in the terminal, seed the database by running:

      npm run seed
